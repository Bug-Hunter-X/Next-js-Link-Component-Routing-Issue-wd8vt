# Next.js Link Component Routing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Next.js `Link` component: unexpected routing behavior.  The provided `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, and `bugSolution.js` offers a corrected implementation.  This issue can stem from incorrect usage of the `href` prop or missing necessary configurations within the Next.js application.

## Problem

The initial implementation of the `Link` component might not correctly navigate to the intended page, potentially leading to a 404 error or unexpected page rendering. This issue can stem from a variety of reasons, including incorrect path specifications, missing `pages` directory structure, and incorrect usage of `basePath` configurations within the next.config.js file. 

## Solution

The solution provided carefully handles the path specification within the `href` prop. It also ensures that necessary configurations are in place within the Next.js application to support the routing. It is important to ensure the `pages` directory is correctly structured and that the paths in the `href` prop exactly match the file names within the `pages` directory.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `pages` directory and check that `profile.js` is there.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm run dev`.
5. Click the 'Go to Profile' link. Note that it might not lead to the correct page.
6. Replace the original `bug.js` file with `bugSolution.js` and rerun the application to observe the correct behavior.
